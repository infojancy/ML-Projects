CBSE Class 12 Result Analysis  - Machine Learning Project
Overview
This ReadMe file provides an introduction to the CBSE Class 12 Result Analysis Machine Learning Project. It outlines the project's purpose, data sources, methodology, and instructions for using the predictive model.

Purpose
The purpose of the CBSE Class 12 Result Analysis  project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical CBSE Class 12 examination data and develop a machine learning model to predict student performance. This project aims to provide insights into past performance trends, identify factors affecting student results, and build a predictive model that can assist educators and students in making data-driven decisions.

Data Sources
The data for this project is typically collected from various sources, which may include: kaggle.com

CBSE Exam Data: Historical data related to Class 12 examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in India. This data includes student scores, demographics, and other relevant information.

Student Information: Details about students, including their attendance records, previous academic performance, extracurricular activities, and socioeconomic background.

School Data: Information about schools, including teacher-student ratios, teaching methodologies, and other school-specific attributes.

Socioeconomic Data: Data on students' and parents' socioeconomic backgrounds, which can impact their academic performance.

Methodology
The CBSE Class 12 Result Analysis project typically follows these steps:

Data Collection: Gather relevant data from various sources, clean and preprocess it to create a structured dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data. This involves data visualization, statistical analysis, and identifying correlations between variables.

Feature Selection: Identify which features (variables) are most relevant for predicting student performance. Feature selection can involve statistical analysis and domain expertise.

Machine Learning Model: Build a machine learning model

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or accuracy, depending on the nature of the prediction task.

Deployment: Once the model performs satisfactorily, it can be deployed to assist educators and students in predicting student performance.

Data Collection: Gather the required data for the students you want to predict. This data should include the same features used to train the model, such as attendance, previous academic scores, demographics, etc.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's in the same format as the training data.
      The data contains school with different regions and percentage of results .
Model Inference: Apply the trained machine learning model to the new data to predict the student's performance.

Interpret Results: Review the prediction to understand the expected performance and make data-informed decisions regarding student support and interventions.

       We can analyse the data set ans conclude the schools which are performed high and which are low. Then we can advise the schools to improve their skills of teachers , students and parents.
